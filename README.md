# djsfuncmds
Discord.js library fun commands to  use for your bot :)


Quick info

I try my best in every command to explain what each line means and what it does
in hopes of people learning something and not just copy pasting
Feel free to post issues and if its an actualy issue with the code i will update it

Some of the code in here is NOT fully made by me but is updated with a little more content and is explained aswell!

Things i will not do :
 i will not help you set up the commands
 i will not show you how to use command handlers 
 i will not help you with errors
