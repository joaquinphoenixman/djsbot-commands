# djsfuncmds
Discord.js library fun commands to  use for your bot :)


Quick info

Some of the code in here is NOT fully made by me but is updated with a little more content and is explained aswell!

Things i will do :

1. I will explain almost every line in hopes of people learning what the code does
2. If requested i will update outdated commands from different bots!
3. I will test each command before posting it, so it does not cause errors!

Things i will not do :

1. I will not help you set up the commands
2. I will not show you how to use command handlers 
3. I will not help you with errors
